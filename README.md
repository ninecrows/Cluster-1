# Cluster-1
Game sandbox for a strategic space game inspired by some old board games.

I've been looking at Unity with a couple of friends from work. We're all pointed in slightly different directions but working together
to find our way around the package.

I've put together some prefab assets to support what I'm aiming for and now I'm looking at adding in some code to instance these and 
start adding in interactivity.

The stars.unity scene loads up a disc of randomly chosen stars. More adjustments to come in frequency and the beginnings of laying in planetary system information and such.
